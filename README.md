# Pandas Module

## About this Module

1. I've started to compare languages. This has helped in translating the results when searching in Google or AI. For example, I knew that 'DISTINCT' did what I needed in SQL for the first part in this assignment, so I asked for a way to make it fit pandas from SQL and it gave me the .nunique() method.
