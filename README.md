# Pandas Module

## About this Module

1. I've started to compare languages. This has helped in translating the results when searching in Google or AI. For example, I knew that 'DISTINCT' did what I needed in SQL for the first part in this assignment, so I asked for a way to make it fit pandas from SQL and it gave me the .nunique() method.
2. This assignment was a big exercise for me in how to use .groupby() where I want to get to an expert degree of proficiency, both because it is useful and it is where I had the most trouble. I went to the Xpert assisstant when I couldn't figure out some errors.
3. One thing I have to thank the Xpert assisstant for is tellling me how to undo the formatting on the spending bins. I couldn't get the bins to connect to the labels with the formatting so I created a new cell where I undid the formatting and added it back just before the printing. This was the most crucial part that I didn't do on my own.
4. The biggest source of help this time around was the Xpert assisstant just for general help with errors and debugging.
